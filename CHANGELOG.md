# Changelog

All notable changes to Max Video Player are listed here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Max Video Player is now licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. Its additional terms require modified versions to credit the original on their About screen and to use their own name and icon. Releases up to 0.5.3 stay under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0. See NOTICE and TRADEMARKS.md (#75).
- Pull requests now need the contributor agreement in CLA.md (#75).

### Added

- Settings > About shows the copyright and license, with links to the license, additional terms, third-party notices and source code of the version you're running (#75).
- THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md lists the licenses of mpv, FFmpeg and every library bundled in the macOS app. The app now includes it, along with LICENSE, NOTICE and TRADEMARKS.md (#75).

## [0.5.3] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- A short disclaimer under Add Provider on the Playlists page, with a link to the full disclaimer (#73).

### Changed

- The macOS app is signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so it opens without a Gatekeeper warning (#67, #70).
- Release downloads no longer have the version in their file names, so links to the latest release always get the newest version.

### Fixed

- The Hardware decoding and Default volume settings had no effect. Hardware decoding now applies from the next video, and new sessions start at the default volume (#69).
- The download folder and the number of downloads that run at once reset when the app restarted (#69).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-10-09

If you are on 0.5.0 or 0.5.1 on macOS, download 0.5.2 manually from the releases page. Those builds crash before they can check for updates, so they cannot update themselves.

### Fixed

- The crash at launch on macOS in 0.5.0 and 0.5.1, caused by duplicate LC_RPATH entries in the bundled libmpv and a bundled SDL library that required SDL3 (#65).

### Changed

- macOS 15 (Sequoia) on Apple Silicon is now the declared minimum. Earlier versions declared macOS 10.15 but needed macOS 15, and 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 needed macOS 26.4 (#65).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-10-09

- Maintenance release. This is a rebuild of 0.5.0 with no code changes, and the macOS build still crashes at launch. Use 0.5.2 instead.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-09

The macOS build of this version crashes at launch and needs macOS 26.4, although it declares an older minimum. Use 0.5.2 instead.

### Added

- Offline downloads for movies and series episodes, with download controls on cards, info panels, the series drawer (per episode and per season) and the player (#63).
- A Downloads tab and a Downloads filter (#63).
- Settings for the download folder and the number of downloads that run at once, and a download history view (#63).
- A retry option for failed downloads (#63).
- Offline episode lists for downloaded series (#63).
- A prompt to resume partially watched movies and episodes (#63).
- A source picker in the player controls and info panels. Switching sources keeps your position (#63).
- Keyboard shortcuts: K to play or pause, F or double-click for fullscreen, M to mute, J and L to seek (with Shift for 30 seconds), 0 to 9 to jump through the video, Home to restart, N and P for the next and previous episode, S for subtitles, I for info, and ? to list all shortcuts (#63).
- On-screen feedback when seeking and changing the volume (#63).
- A message for searches with no results, with a button to clear the search (#63).

### Changed

- The app's visible name is now "Max Video Player" (#63).
- Switching tabs keeps your search text (#63).
- Leaving the player returns to the tab you came from (#63).
- Episodes play directly from History (#63).
- The app remembers the volume between sessions, and unmuting restores the previous volume (#63).
- Xtream shows split across several series are merged into one, with duplicate episodes listed as extra sources (#63).

### Fixed

- The startup screen reporting failed playlist and EPG refreshes as done (#63).

### Removed

- The channel list inside the player, opened with the C key (#63).

## [0.4.9] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Automatic reconnection after network outages, resuming playback where it stopped (#62).
- A connection status overlay that shows connection issues, a lost connection with the attempt count, an unavailable stream with a Retry button, and a restored connection (#62).

## [0.4.8] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- On Linux X11 sessions, video now plays in a separate window. It still plays inside the app on Wayland (#61).

- Video corruption when resizing the window on Linux (#61).
- A crash and a screen flash when stopping playback on Linux (#61).
- Player keyboard controls not working until the player was clicked (#61).
- The startup screen closing before channels finished loading (#61).
- Audio being turned off by a system or user mpv config on Linux. The app now ignores mpv.conf (#61).

## [0.4.7] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- The .deb and .rpm packages now depend on the audio and subtitle libraries, and in-app .deb updates install any that are missing (#60).

### Fixed

- Missing audio on Linux when the system libmpv had no audio output. The AppImage now includes its own libmpv with audio support (#60).

## [0.4.6] - 2026-04-07

### Added

### Added

- In-app updates for .deb and .rpm installs on Linux, which ask for your password to install (#47).

### Changed
