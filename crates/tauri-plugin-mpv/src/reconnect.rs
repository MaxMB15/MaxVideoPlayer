//! Background watcher that auto-recovers playback after network outages.
//!
//! ## Failure signals
//!
//! Network problems manifest several ways inside libmpv. We listen for all
//! of them — duplicated signals are deduplicated by `next_retry_at`:
//!
//! 1. **Soft stall (FFmpeg silently retrying).** With
//!    `stream-lavf-o=reconnect=1,reconnect_streamed=1`, FFmpeg retries the
//!    underlying HTTP read forever — the demuxer never raises an error and
//!    the only outward sign is that mpv's demuxer cache drains and
//!    `paused-for-cache` flips to `true`. This is the COMMON case during
//!    Wi-Fi drops / network switches.
//!
//!    We observe `paused-for-cache` and emit `mpv://buffering` /
//!    `mpv://buffered` so the UI can show a connection-issues overlay
//!    within seconds. No `loadfile` is re-issued — FFmpeg's own reconnect
//!    handles recovery.
//!
//! 2. **Hard failure (`EndFile(Error)` or libmpv2-swallowed equivalent).**
//!    Some providers force-close the connection, return 5xx, or libmpv's
//!    own `network-timeout` fires before FFmpeg's reconnect could establish
//!    a session. The demuxer raises `MPV_EVENT_END_FILE` with
//!    `reason == MPV_END_FILE_REASON_ERROR`. **Important quirk:** libmpv2's
//!    `wait_event` wrapper short-circuits *any* `END_FILE` whose
//!    `end_file.error` is non-zero into an opaque `Err(Error::Raw(...))` —
//!    the `Event::EndFile(reason)` arm never runs in that case. mpv sets
//!    `end_file.error` on most abnormal ends (premature truncation, network
//!    error, decode-pipeline shutdown), so the `Event::EndFile(Error)` arm
//!    fires far less often than naïve reading of the libmpv docs suggests.
//!
//! 3. **Premature EOF.** FFmpeg's HTTP demuxer can also exhaust its retry
//!    budget while the connection itself ended "cleanly" (server closed the
//!    socket, or `Content-Length` claimed more bytes than were delivered).
//!    With `keep-open=yes` mpv parks at the truncation point; pressing play
//!    just bounces back to paused because there is nothing left to read.
//!
//! ## Why we observe `eof-reached` and `idle-active`
//!
//! Because libmpv2 silently drops most error-flavoured `EndFile` events
//! (see (2) above), relying on `Event::EndFile` alone leaves the watcher
//! blind during exactly the scenarios it's supposed to recover from. To
//! sidestep that limitation we observe two boolean properties whose
//! `PropertyChange` events are NOT gated by `event.error`:
//!
//! - `eof-reached` flips to `true` whenever the demuxer reaches EOF —
//!   premature or otherwise. Combined with a `time-pos` vs `duration`
//!   check, it gives us a reliable "stream ran out" signal even when
//!   `EndFile` is squelched.
//! - `idle-active` flips to `true` when mpv unloads the file entirely
//!   (the hard-error path with `keep-open=yes`: errors quit, EOF doesn't).
//!   We treat it as a trigger only after we've seen real playback
//!   (`last_known_pos > 1.0`) so the property's initial transient during
//!   startup doesn't fire a false alarm.
//!
//! Whichever signal arrives first arms the retry; subsequent duplicates
//! are no-ops thanks to the `next_retry_at` guard.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! - One monitor thread per `load()`. Spawned at the end of `load_impl` once
//!   playback has actually started.
//! - The thread owns its own `Mpv` client handle (independent event queue,
//!   but full command capability — it can re-issue `loadfile`).
//! - The thread exits cleanly on `MPV_EVENT_SHUTDOWN`, which fires when the
//!   parent `Mpv` is dropped. This means we *never* need an explicit kill
//!   flag: `stop()` / a new `load()` drop the engine, which destroys the
//!   parent, which terminates the client, which wakes the thread.
